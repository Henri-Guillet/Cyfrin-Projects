# Foundry Basic Upgradeable Contract Example

This project is based on a section of the [Cyfrin Foundry Solidity Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-upgrades-cu).

This project is a simple and minimal example demonstrating how to build and interact with an upgradeable smart contract using OpenZeppelin's UUPS proxy pattern.

The contract is written in Solidity and tested using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
