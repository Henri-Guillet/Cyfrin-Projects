# Foundry Minimal Account Abstraction Contract Example

This project is based on a section of the [Cyfrin Foundry Solidity Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/minimal-account-abstraction).

This project is a minimal example demonstrating how to build a smart account in order to use account abstraction on ethereum mainnet.

The contract is written in Solidity and tested using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
